Inertia
=======

A simple, fast, entity component framework.

## Building
__Note:__ If you do not have [Gradle] installed then use `./gradlew` for Unix systems or Git Bash and gradlew.bat for Windows systems in place of any 'gradle' command.

In order to build Flare you simply need to run the `gradle` command. You can find the compiled JAR file in `./inertia/build/libs` labeled 'inertia-0.1.0.jar'.
